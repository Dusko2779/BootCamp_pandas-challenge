In this analysis we looked at different matrix between 15 government and independent schools in respect to school size, spending rage per student, budget etc. We particularly focused on average maths and reading scores along with % passing for each and overall passing. 

We can conclude the following results and trends; 

In the top performing schools by % overall passing 3 out of 5 top performing schools are independent and on the contrast in the bottom performing schools 4 out of 5 are government. 

Interestingly students in the lower spending per student range achieved overall higher results in all categories. 

Small school sizes of <1000 students outperformed and achieved higher results in all categories over schools with 2000-5000 students. 

Independent schools outperformed government schools in all categories from average math and reading scores to overall passing percentage as well. 

Obviously, there are certain limitations with this data, and we only selected certain parameters to do out comparisons however we did not have any insight into the qualifications of the teaching staff and any curriculum criteria or standards between independent and government schools.
